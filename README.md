We will use Hypothesis Testing to check if new website page helped increase customer conversion rate

## We will use Chi Square Test to check if designing a new website for our client helped them increase the customer conversion rate or not

1. The customers were divided into 2 groups -
   a) Control Group - Customers that viewed the old version of the website
   b) Treatment Group - Customers that viewed the new version of the website

2. After some data cleaning, here are some statsitics

3. Now we define our Null and Alternate Hypothesis and based on p=0.05, we either reject or accept the null hypothesis

4. After getting the Chi-sq statistics of 0.35 which is greater than the threshold of 0.05, we can conclude that there is no stong evidence to reject the null hypothesis
5. __Conclusion__ - New website did not have any significant impact on Customer Conversion
